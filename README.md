There are seven games that you can play and six games that you can bet on in this program. There is blackjack, roulette, craps, poker, ceelo, bacarrat, and yahtzee. It is entirely 
text-based and asks the player which game they want to play. Each game asks the player how much they want to bet.

Roulette asks what kind of bet you want to make and pays out depending on the bet made. You can bet an
odd bet, even bet, bet on red, bet on black, column bets, dozen bets, bets from 1-18, bets from 19-36,
and a single bet.

By playing craps, you can make a passline bet, a don't pass bet, a field bet, an eleven roll bet, a
three roll bet, snake eyes bet, twelve roll bet, hi-lo bet, craps roll, or a seven roll bet. Pay outs 
for all bets depend on the bet chosen.

Poker creates a deck of 52 cards and randomly shuffles them. Then, it deals you five cards and the
dealer five cards. If your hand is better than the dealers hand, then your bet doubles. If the dealer
hand is the same as yours, it is a push. If the dealer's hand is better than yours, you lose.

Blackjack deals you two cards from a randomly shuffled deck. You can see one of the dealer's cards
face up, but not the other one. You can decide to hit or stay. If you bust, then you lose. If you 
stay, the dealer then proceeds with his turn. If the dealer's hand is better than yours, you win. If
the dealer busts you win.

Ceelo is a simple game that uses three dice. The game is a head-to-head version of ceelo with a banker
and a player. The banker rolls first. A banker could roll a 1-2-3, 4-5-6, a pair, three-of-a-kind, or junk.
If the banker rolls junk, then the banker rerolls. If the banker rolls a 1-2-3, then they instantly lose.
If the banker rolls a 4-5-6, then the banker instantly wins. A 4-5-6 is an instant win like getting a blackjack.
If the dealer rolls a pair, the value of the other die is the point. If the dealer rolls
a three-of-a-kind, then the value is the three-of-a-kind rolled. After the banker rolls a pair or
three-of-a-kind, then the player rolls. A player must roll a value higher than the banker. A higher point
value if both parties got a pair, or a higher three-of-a-kind. A three-of-a-kind beats any pair. A higher
three-of-a-kind beats a lower three-of-a-kind. A roll of a 1-2-3 is an instant loss and a roll of a 4-5-6
is an instant win, just like the banker's roll.

Baccarat is a game where the dealer and the player is given two cards. The face cards are all worth zero.
The player wants to have the value of their two cards added together to be closer to nine than the dealer's
two cards added together. If the sum is greater than 9, then you subtract 10 from the total. For example, an
8 and a 6 would end up being worth 4.

Yahtzee is a game without betting. Yahtzee is played with five dice. You want to get various combinations of
dice to score points. You can also choose to reroll one of the dice to get a better score. But you can only
reroll so many times. There are 13 different types of rolls you can select. Aces, twos, threes, fours, fives,
sixes, small straight, large straight, three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, chance, and yahtzee. Aces
counts all the 1s you have as points, Twos counts all the 2s you have as points. Threes counts all the 3s
you have as points. Fours counts all the 4s you have as points. Fives counts all the 5s you have as points.
Sixes counts all the 6s you have as points. Small straight only counts if you 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Large straight
only counts if you have 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Three-of-a-Kind counts only if you have three of the same number.
Four-of-a-kind only counts if you have four of the same number. Full house only counts if you have a
three-of-a-kind and a unique pair. Chance adds up the total of all the dice. Yahtzee only counts if all five of
the dice have the same number.
